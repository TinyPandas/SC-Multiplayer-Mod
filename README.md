This repo will be used to handle and track bugs and suggestions


# Server Setup Instructions
- Download the version under [releases](https://github.com/TinyPandas/SC-Multiplayer-Mod/releases).
- Extract the contents of the zip to a folder
- Inside the folder, edit the `config.json` file.
- Save `config.json` and run `start_server.bat`.

## As of now, I can only guarantee the server runs on Windows 11
